## The Purpose of Story Telling

UX storytelling allows designers to imagine what it is like to use the website through another personâ€™s perspective to create the best and most efficient website or app. Creating personas allows researchers to understand their target users. This is an alternative way to evaluate a website compared to heuristic evaluations and interviews. The purpose of this is to gain insight about the usability and pain points of the site. 


## Design Features:
Based on my previous research, I plan to implement 2 design features that will help users with the usability of the website. 

Search Bar: Clear and easily visible search bar in the top right corner to allow users to search for specific parts of the electronic music learning website.

Numbered Navigation Bar: Create a navigation bar at the bottom of the page to easily toggle between pages instead of clicking the back or next button multiple times
