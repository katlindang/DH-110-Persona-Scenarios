## The Purpose of Story Telling

UX storytelling allows designers to imagine what it is like to use the website through another person’s perspective to create the best and most efficient website or app. Creating personas allows researchers to understand their target users. This is an alternative way to evaluate a website compared to heuristic evaluations and interviews. The purpose of this is to gain insight about the usability and pain points of the site. 


## Design Features:
Based on my previous research, I plan to implement 2 design features that will help users with the usability of the website. 

Search Bar: Clear and easily visible search bar in the top right corner to allow users to search for specific parts of the electronic music learning website.

Numbered Navigation Bar: Create a navigation bar at the bottom of the page to easily toggle between pages instead of clicking the back or next button multiple times

## Scenarios & Journey Map

## Derek Singh's Scenario & Journey Map

### Why Derek is using this product
> Derek is way too ambitious for his own good. He is a web developer for Google and invests in crypto and stocks with the rest of his time. Derek often finds himself getting bored of his hobbies and work and needs excitement and something different in his life. He has a passion for music, specifically EDM. Derek has been thinking about pursuing music as his full time career, but doesn’t know proper music structure nor the rules to the beats and tempos. Derek does have a soundboard and would occasionally put beats together.  He wants to start off by selling beats, but his knowledge on the basic electronic music terminology is lacking. He wants to use this website to learn these terminology and basic song structures to create beats to sell to people.


### How Derek is using this product

> While at work, Derek decides to look up electronic music learning on his computer. A website pops up with an interactive page and a simple design. As a web developer, Derek admires the simplicity of the website with clear and concise information. He decides to follow the path of the website and it takes him step by step through learning how to put beats together. As he comes across the “Tempos and Beats” section, he took interest in the tempo ranges. He saw that techno/trance fell into the tempo ranges of 120-140 bpm. He mentally took notes of that, so he could set his tempo ranges on his sound board to the right tempo. 


## Manny Moa's Scenario & Journey Map

### Why Manny is using this product

> Manny recently started making music again. He has a new found appreciation for electronic music and wants to try to incorporate electronic music with Reggae and Hip-Hop. Manny has been overwhelmed with work lately. He feels like he is too busy trying to pay bills and survive that he doesn’t have much time and money to make music. Manny knows the basics of electronic music because he grew up watching his family produce and make music. Manny has an idea what he wants to do, but feels limited because he doesn’t have much money to buy a sound board to practice with. Manny was referred to this site by his friend that was also interested in electronic music. He told Manny that there were inclusions of interactive soundboards and visuals for sheet music learning. He doesn't know how to read sheet music, so this site is also useful for Manny to visualize and hear which sounds go with the notes.

### How Manny is using this product

> After work, Manny opens the website his friend referred to him. The interactive soundboard on the opening page draws Manny in. He spends a few moments playing with different beats and seeing how they sound together. Manny follows the path of the website, but realizes that he knows a lot of the information there already. He, then, goes to the hamburger icon to look through categories. He sees a category that says “The Playground” and decides to click on it. He was greeted by a few interactive soundboards. He plays around with the sounds and listen to how each of the notes differ. Manny is an auditory learner, so he is able to pick up and understand the music and sounds quickly.
